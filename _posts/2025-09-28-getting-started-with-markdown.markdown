Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write rich text. Here are some quick examples:

- Headings: `#`, `##`, `###`
- Emphasis: `**bold**`, `*italic*`
- Lists: `- item`
- Code: `` `inline` `` or fenced code blocks

```markdown
# Example heading
This is a paragraph with **bold** text.
```

Start writing your posts in the `_posts/` directory using the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown`.
