excerpt: "Key takeaways and reference notes from studying algorithms and data structures."

In this series of notes I collect important algorithms, complexities, and example code snippets.

#### Topics covered

- Sorting algorithms and their trade-offs
- Common data structures: arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps
- Big-O analysis and practical optimization tips

These notes are intended as a quick reference while solving problems and building small projects.
