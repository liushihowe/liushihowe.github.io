This site is powered by MarkdownHome — a minimalist Jekyll starter theme that lets you build a personal website and blog using only Markdown. The homepage below highlights the project's features and gives quick steps to get started.

## ✨ Features

- Ready-to-use Jekyll starter with sensible defaults
- Write content in Markdown; the theme handles layout and styling

## 🚀 Quick start (copy & use)

1. Use this repository as a template: click "Use this template" on GitHub or clone it locally.
2. Open `_config.yml` and set your site information (title, description, url, baseurl) and any social links.
3. Add or edit content: create pages in the repository root (e.g. `about.md`) and blog posts in `_posts/`.
4. Commit and push to your remote repository. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository or host the generated site with your preferred static host.

## 📁 Project structure (what matters)

- `_posts/` — blog posts, named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `_sass/` — theme templates and styles
- `assets/` — static assets (CSS, images)

## 🔗 Quick links

- All posts: [Posts archive]({{ "/posts/" | relative_url }})
- About: [About MakedownHome]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }})

Feel free to edit this page to add a short welcome message, featured posts, or links to your projects.
